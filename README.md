# Python Code Jam Qualifier Summer 2021

### What is the Code Jam?
The Python Code Jam is an event hosted by the [Python Discord](https://github.com/python-discord). The code jam is an event where [Python Discord](https://github.com/python-discord) place you in a team with 5 or 6 other random server members. You then have 7 days to code some sort of application or program in Python. Your program must use the specified technology/framework and incorporate the theme chosen by the server. After the 7 days is complete, your team has 2 days to finish documentation and create a video presentation showcasing and walking through the program that your team has created. ~ [Python Discord](https://github.com/python-discord)

### How can I participate?
If you don't pass the qualifier self until 30 June, you can't!. But don't worry. The Discord Server of [Python Discord](https://discord.gg/python) host the **Code Jam** twice a year, so try to qualify next time.

### How to test the qualifier?
+ Make sure the 3 files, [`qualifier.py`](qualifier/qualifier.py), [`local_test_suite.py`](qualifier/local_test_suite.py) and [`test_qualifier.py`](qualifier/test_qualifier.py) are in the same directory
+ Open PowerShell or another terminal
+ Change your directory to the folder with the qualifier and the test files<br>PowerShell command `cd Your\Path`
+ Type in PowerShell `python -m unittest local_test_suite.py`
+ Enjoy how it works üçπüèñÔ∏èüòé
